# PaintBall TD
Welcome to **PaintBall TD**, a vibrant tower defense game where you must stop waves of mischievous paintballs from reaching their goal. Strategize, build turrets, and defend your tracks!

## A Solo Effort
This project was supposed to be a group project, but it turned into a completely **solo effort** due to a team fallout. All the code, design, and implementation were done solely by me, and no other group members had access to the GitHub repository or contributed in any way.

## Features
- Multiple unique tracks, each increasing in difficulty.
- Four turret types:
    - **Standard Turret**: Reliable, steady damage.
    - **Cannon Turret**: Explosive damage radius.
    - **Laser Turret**: Slows enemies while dealing light damage.
    - **Sniper Turret**: Infinite range but slow rate of fire.
- Dynamic camera controls with **WASD**, mouse positioning, and zoom.
- Challenging enemy waves with increasing difficulty.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Unity **6.0.0** or newer. (I was instructed to update to Unity 6 by Unity tech support due to older versions not being supported and causing corruptions of assets. Teaching staff was not available until the due date to consult.)
